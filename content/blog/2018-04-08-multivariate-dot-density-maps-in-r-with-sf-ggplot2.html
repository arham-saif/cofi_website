<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Last June I did a <a href="https://www.blog.cultureofinsight.com/2017/06/building-dot-density-maps-with-uk-census-data-in-r/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about building dot-denisty maps in R using UK Census data. It has proven to be a fairly popular post, most likely due to the maps looking like something you’re more likely to see in the Tate Modern…</p>

<p>Not only do these maps looks beautiful, but there is a strong argument that they do a better job of representing data than There seems to have been a recent surge of interest in this type of mapping, largely due to this xkcd interpretation of the 2016 US Election…</p>

<p>Now I’m not going to say these maps were completely and utterly inspired by the take <em>alllll</em> the credit for this new wave of dot-density enthusiasm… but it’s great to see it gaining more traction as a method for visualising spatial data.</p>
<p>The pièce de résistance of this method of mapping is that it does not suffer from the tendency of over-emphasising the influence of large, yet sparsely populated areas, as colour-coverage is dictated by count, not area size.</p>
<p>When applied to election mapping, this gives a fairer assessment of the ‘popular vote’ when compared to a standard Choropleth map that fills entire regions with the colour of the winning party, regardless of how close the contest was or how many people voted.</p>
<p>For a more enlightented discussion on the troubles and strifes of accurate mapping, check out the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/65b5df0e-49ff-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb" target="_blank">latest FT chart doctor article</a>, where the <a href="https://twitter.com/theboysmithy" target="_blank">FT’s Alan Smith</a> talks with professor Mark Monmonier, author of the classic book <em>How to Lie With Maps</em>. (while you’re at it, have a look at <a href="https://twitter.com/sdbernard" target="_blank">Steven Bernard’s</a> piece on how the FT’s always-on-point maps are made <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/35188c6a-4870-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<h2>R’s New Spatial Workflow</h2>
<p>With all of this in mind, I thought it would be a good time to update the previous blog post, this time utilising the relatively new <a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/" target="_blank">simple features (sf) R package</a>. sf makes it a lot easier to do geospatial analysis within a <em>tidy framework</em>, ergo making it work seamlessly with the tidyverse, as all geospatial data is bundled into a list and treated as a single observation of a geographic variable in a data frame.</p>
<p>This means we can go from raw data -&gt; dot density map with a lot less code and stress than ever before. So here’s a quick demo of how to get it done, this time as a map of 2016 UK General Election results in London Constituancies…</p>

<div id="load-packages-and-get-some-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Load Packages and Get Some Data</h2>
<p>First lets get some election data and a constituency level shapefile then select/rename the columns we need in each and join them together.</p>
<p>I filter each dataset to the London region but if you’re doing this yourself and want to map another region, you can simply switch London out for the region of your choice and continue on.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse) # dev version of ggplot2 required devtools::install_github(&#39;hadley/ggplot2&#39;)
library(sf)

# election results filtered to London region
ge_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7979/HoC-GE2017-constituency-results.csv&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(region_name == &quot;London&quot;) %&gt;% 
  select(ons_id, constituency_name, first_party, Con = con, Lab = lab, LD = ld, UKIP = ukip, Green = green)

# shapefile filtered to London region

  st_transform(4326) %&gt;%

  select(ons_id = PCONCODE)

# merge the data

<div id="generating-coordinates-for-each-dot" class="section level2">
<h2>Generating Coordinates for each Dot</h2>
<p>Here we create a data frame with the number of dots we want plotted in each constituency for each party. Dividing total vote count by 100 means that each dot will represent 100 votes. Then we plug this data into a <code>purrr::map_df</code> call and let it pipe it’s way to a nice tidy tibble with coordinates columns and a categorical column for the politcal party assignment of each dot.</p>
<p>It took me a while to figure how to do this is in one pipe. The tricky part was realising that the ‘geometry set’ produced after the <code>st_sample</code> stage (generation of coordinates) has the top level ‘geometry type’ of <code>GEOMETRY</code> but in order for us to be able to scrape the the coordinates with the <code>st_coordinates</code> function, we must first simplify the geometry type to <code>POINT</code> with <code>st_cast</code> function…</p>
<pre class="r"><code># data frame of number of dots to plot for each party (1 for every 100 votes)
num_dots &lt;- ceiling(select(as.data.frame(sf_data), Con:Green) / 100)

                  ~ st_sample(sf_data, size = num_dots[,.x], type = &quot;random&quot;) %&gt;% # generate the points in each polygon

                    mutate(Party = factor(.x, levels = names((num_dots))))        # add categorical party variable

<h2>Visualise the Votes</h2>
<p>Here’s my <code>ggplot2</code> code for the map output. Plotting this many points on a standard sized plot image won’t be particularly insightful as there will be severe over-plotting. So play around with your image size until it’s looking good, then adjust the text and legend sizes to compensate for the enlarged plot</p>

<p>What do we think is the most insightful map? Luckily we don’t have to choose one or the other, can use both! No one map will be able to give the you all the answers so I find that it’s best to combine techniques for maximum insight. The choropleth gives us a clear indication as to who won where, and the dot-density looks under the hood and gives us an idea of the count and diversity of votes within each constituency.</p>
