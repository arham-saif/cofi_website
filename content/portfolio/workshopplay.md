We've just re-built Exterion Media's <a href="https://cultureofinsight.shinyapps.io/workshopplay" target="_blank">Work Shop Play survey dashboard!</a> The dashboard is updated monthly with 3-4 new surveys across a variety of topics of relevance to the 'Work.Shop.Play Urban Community' and has the following features built in:

* A reactive front-end design with compatibility across all device platforms: **Desktop, Tablet & Mobile**
* Interactive user inputs to compare survey responses across a wide range of demographic target groups
* **Branded chart image exports** and data exports to CSV or Excel
